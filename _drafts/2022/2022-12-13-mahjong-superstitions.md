Let's talk about superstitions.
Being an occult player myself, I will not try to disprove any of these.
Sure, there are some I follow and others I don't subscribe to that much.
I see it that way: good superstitions are just some shorthand for some complex math, I don't need to bother thinking about it.
That being said, the Western Riichi online sphere is hostile, very hostile against occult players.
If you don't believe in these, that's fine.
But for the love of all that's holy to you, be civil about it.

## “Lalafell have all the luck!”

Let's start with a current one:
In Final Fantasy XIV Online, being a Lalafell seems to have an influence on luck - more opening gates in treasure maps, more loot, better rolls on loot etc.
Even in Doman Mahjong, they get more kandora, more uradora, more riichi ippatsu tsumo.
Most of the better performing players are Popotoes!

So get your Fantasia and join the dark side!

## “If you're 3rd, and the last dealer is 4th, he will go on a luck streak and blast your ass down to 4th.”

This is a situation you commonly see in online games:
One player, the last dealer, barely wins any hands, but on their orasu, they start winning.
Sometimes they win so much, they get even first.

## Clothes

What kind of clothes do you wear while playing mahjong?
Apparently, wearing red underwear brings luck in mahjong.
I'm not entirely convinced, think it should be yellow, if you subscribe to this.
I would try this out, but after opening my drawer, I've only found blue and black pants.

## “Reversing the Flow”

You play at an automatic table and have bad luck?
You can try this at your own risk: try reversing the polarity!
Unplug the table, turn the plug by 180 degrees and plug it in again.
Oh wait, that not always an option…

## “Gotta go fast”


## Shuffling Tiles

This has nothing to do with playing mahjong, but I heard the noise of shuffling tiles is supposed to bring luck.
So shuffle like you mean it, assuming you're playing without an automatic table.

I shouldn't tell all of you this very legit hot FFXIV mahjong secret before the end of the tournament but if you queue for a game as WAR you can Holmgang to prevent your points from dropping below 1 for the next hand 🤫 (ONLY works in FFXIV!!)
