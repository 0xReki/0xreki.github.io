Lot‚Äôs of people will buy it and get exposed to Riichi.‚ÄÇWhich means more potential players.‚ÄÇAnd it made by Nintendo, that set the bar slightly higher. Now it‚Äôs finally out and I dove straight in, ignoring all other games (and sleep).‚ÄÇAs such, this is only a look at Riichi Mahjong in Clubhouse Games.‚ÄÇThis is not a full review of Clubhouse Games. The Visual Experience at the Table The interface looks neat as expected.‚ÄÇThe Nintendo Phoenix tileset is a nice touch.‚ÄÇ(Yes, Nintendo still sells those sets!) The Dora indicators are in the left upper corner.‚ÄÇAll the information about the current deal like the current round and seat winds and numbers of tiles left in the wall is displayed in the center. On the right above your hand, there‚Äôs your shanten.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre tenpai, on the left above your hand you‚Äôll see what tiles you can win on.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre furiten, it gets displayed there, too.‚ÄÇDora turn reddish when you have them in your hand.‚ÄÇThey turn back to white when you discard them.‚ÄÇOn calling, there is no ghost tile in the discard pool.‚ÄÇTiles move with some animation but there are no hands involved. You can look up the list of yaku whenever it‚Äôs your turn by pressing L (or ZL).‚ÄÇDisabling and reenabling calls are done by pressing R (or ZR).‚ÄÇFor any call that opens your hand the default option is to pass on the call.‚ÄÇIf you want to call, you need to press Up to select the call.‚ÄÇFor closed kans and riichi, the default is to declare.‚ÄÇIf you don‚Äôt want to, press Down to select your discard.‚ÄÇSelecting riichi is not committing.‚ÄÇYou can still opt-out by pressing B and you do have to confirm riichi by after selecting the tile to discard.‚ÄÇThis might get used to because as it‚Äôs an extra step compared to other platforms.‚ÄÇThere is no autowin option. You if pay attention you can see if the tiles are being discarded from the hand or if it was the tile that was just drawn.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no option to manually sort the hand. The Audio Experience To be honest, it sounds a bit like Animal Crossing, but it‚Äôs definitely not annoying if you listen to it for too long.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd prefer some variety though. Scoring of a Hand Scoring is as you would expect.‚ÄÇNow might be a good time to mention there are no replays.‚ÄÇSo if you want to share your big hand you need to screenshot it immediately.‚ÄÇLuckily, the Switch has a Screenshot button.‚ÄÇThe only minus is you can‚Äôt get the difference to other players displayed.‚ÄÇThe translation is‚Ä¶ interesting.‚ÄÇIn the hints they suggest learning the Japanase terms but sadly, there‚Äôs no option to enable the Japanase terms. EDIT 2020-06-06 21:00: There‚Äôs one thing to nitpick about: I can‚Äôt agree with the notion that anything but 1st place is failure. Stuff for Beginners The tutorial is short, very short.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs three lessons.‚ÄÇBut they do warn you about the complexity of the game.‚ÄÇYou can look up the list of yaku whenever it‚Äôs your turn by pressing L (or ZL).‚ÄÇIt also gives you a recommendation to what go for.‚ÄÇThe default is the global tileset which is still the Nintendo Phoenix set with extra coloured bars and Arabic numerals. Rulesets Let‚Äôs talk about rulesets: you can choose between East-Only (tonpuusen) and East¬†+¬†South (hanchan).‚ÄÇAlso, you can choose to enable red Dora or not.‚ÄÇThe last choice in the ruleset section doesn‚Äôt affect the rules: the tileset.‚ÄÇYou can go for the default global set.‚ÄÇChoosing traditional set just gives you the Nintendo Phoenix tiles as is. The rule variation for all kinds of games, as far as I have confirmed are: Players start on points 25,000 No return, no placement bonus In case multiple people end up on the same rank, the one closer to the initial East gets higher placement The games ends if a player falls below zero points (tobi) South 4 Round doesn‚Äôt end when dealership doesn‚Äôt pass (no agariyame) Open tanyao is allowed (kuitan ari) Abortive draws for 9 unique terminals/honours in starting hand (kyuushuu kyuuhai) If you find any mistake or have more information, please get in touch. A special quirk I found is honba resetting when the dealership changes on a draw. Online Experience So far that‚Äôs just the offline and friend lobby games, both local and online.‚ÄÇHow about matched games online? For some strange reason, you can only choose between tilesets.‚ÄÇThe default ruleset is East-Only with Red Dora.‚ÄÇAn option to choose between East-Only and East+South or disabling red dora would make much more sense here.‚ÄÇSince the tileset doesn‚Äôt affect the rules.‚ÄÇI hope this gets changed in a future patch. For the most part, it works just fine.‚ÄÇBut just in case you get a bad connection navigating through the tiles can lag badly.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs inconceivable to me navigating through your hand can lag but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable.‚ÄÇEspecially with the short time you have to choose your actions.‚ÄÇThe time for your turns are 10s + 3x10s.‚ÄÇBut!!!! You need to manually give yourself more time from your pool by pressing Y. EDIT 2020-06-05 22:40: If someone in your game disconnects they get replaced by a bot which is a big plus if you have suffered through enough diconnecting players in other platforms. EDIT 2020-06-07 16:10: If you‚Äôre the last person in a multiplayer game, the game gets cancelled instead. In Short I need to redo the other reviews with a more rigid point score.‚ÄÇThis is why instead of averaging points I‚Äôm taking the sum. Beginner Friendliness: 5 Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) In-Game Yaku List (1) Seat Wind Indicator (1) Short Tutorial (1) Basic Usability: 3/5 Manual Extra Time (-2) Extra Usabilty: 3/5 No Auto-Win (-1) No Manual Sorting (-1) Audio: 2 Monotone, but not annoying Goodies: 2 Nintendo Phoenix Tiles (1) Disconnected players get replaced by bots (1) Sum: 16 Points Overall I actually enjoy this more than Mahjong Soul.‚ÄÇI hope to see more people playing online.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-hidden> A Look At Riichi Mahjong in Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics </h1> <div class="d-none" id="talkify-title" aria-flowto="talkify-metadata"> <p>0xReki's Adventures by Night<p> <p>A Look At Riichi Mahjong in Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics<p> </div> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left"> published on 2020-06-05, last updated on 2021-06-11 </small> <small class="float-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> </small> <div class="clearfix"></div> <small> tagged with <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/games/">Games</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/hobbies/">Hobbies</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/riichi-mahjong/">Riichi Mahjong</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/review/">Review</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/nintendo/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/nintendo-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> </small> </div> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 mt-2"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Blog Technology 2020" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2020/05-22-blog-technology-2020">Blog Technology 2020</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Why my Software Library Looks so Random" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2020/06-06-why-my-software-library-looks-so-random">Why my Software Library Looks so Random</a> <nav> </header> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="post-content"> <!--sse--> <p>When ‚ÄúClubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics‚Äù was announced I was hyped to hear Riichi Mahjong would be included among the games.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúI hope this is going to be good,‚Äù is what came to my mind.‚ÄÇWhy?
