Lots of people will buy it and get exposed to Riichi, which means more potential players to play with.‚ÄÇAnd since it‚Äôs made by Nintendo, the bar is set slightly higher. It‚Äôs finally out, and I dove straight in, ignoring all other games (and sleep).‚ÄÇAs such, this is only a look at Riichi Mahjong in Clubhouse Games.‚ÄÇThis is not a full review of Clubhouse Games.‚ÄÇ The Visual Experience at the Table The interface looks neat as expected.‚ÄÇThe Nintendo ‚ÄúYakuman Phoenix‚Äù tile set is a nice touch.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs easy to spot since it‚Äôs more or less the only set with a tortoise in the 1 pin.‚ÄÇBy the way, Nintendo still sells those sets! The Dora indicators are in the left upper corner.‚ÄÇAll the information about the current deal,¬†e.‚ÄØg.,¬†the current round and seat winds and numbers of tiles left in the wall, is displayed in the centre. On the right, above your hand, your shanten is displayed.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre tenpai, on the left above your hand, you‚Äôll see what tiles you can win on.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre furiten, it gets displayed there, too.‚ÄÇDora turn red when you have them in your hand.‚ÄÇThey turn back to white when you discard them.‚ÄÇAfter being caled, there is no ghost tile in the discard pool.‚ÄÇTiles move with some animations, but there are no hands involved. You can look up the list of yaku whenever it‚Äôs your turn by pressing L (or ZL).‚ÄÇDisabling and re-enabling calls are done by pressing R (or ZR).‚ÄÇFor any call that opens your hand, the default option is to pass on the call.‚ÄÇIf you want to call, you need to press Up to select the call.‚ÄÇFor closed kans and riichi, the default is to declare.‚ÄÇIf you don‚Äôt want to, press Down to select your discard.‚ÄÇSelecting riichi is not committing.‚ÄÇYou can still opt-out by pressing B, and you do have to confirm riichi by after selecting the tile to discard.‚ÄÇThis might get used to because as it‚Äôs an extra step compared to other platforms.‚ÄÇThere is no option to win automatically. If you pay attention, you can see if the tiles are being discarded from the hand or if it was the tile that was just drawn.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no other way to get that information.‚ÄÇSadyl, there‚Äôs no option to manually sort the hand. The Audio Experience To be honest, it sounds a bit like Animal Crossing, but it‚Äôs definitely not annoying if you listen to it for too long.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd prefer some variety though. Scoring of a Hand Scoring is as you would expect.‚ÄÇNow might be a good time to mention there are no replays.‚ÄÇSo if you want to share your big hand, you need to screenshot it immediately.‚ÄÇLuckily, the Switch has a Screenshot button.‚ÄÇThe only minus is you can‚Äôt get the difference to other players displayed.‚ÄÇThe translation is‚Ä¶ interesting.‚ÄÇIn the hints they suggest learning the Japanese terms but sadly, there‚Äôs no option to enable the Japanese terms. EDIT 2020-06-06 21:00: There‚Äôs one thing to nitpick about: I can‚Äôt agree with the notion that anything but 1st place is failure. Stuff for Beginners The tutorial is short, very short.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs just three lessons.‚ÄÇBut they do warn you about the complexity of the game.‚ÄÇAs mentoined above, you can look up the list of yaku whenever it‚Äôs your turn by pressing L (or ZL).‚ÄÇIt also gives you a recommendation to what yaku to go for.‚ÄÇThe default is the global tile set which is still the Nintendo Phoenix set with extra coloured bars and Arabic numerals for ease of access. Rule Sets Let‚Äôs talk about rule sets: you can choose between East-Only (tonpuusen) and East¬†+¬†South (hanchan).‚ÄÇAlso, you can choose to enable red Dora or not.‚ÄÇThe last choice in the rule set section doesn‚Äôt affect the rules: the tile set.‚ÄÇYou can go for the default global set.‚ÄÇChoosing the traditional set just gives you the Nintendo Phoenix tiles as is. The rule variation for all kinds of games, as far as I have confirmed, are: Players start on points 25,000 No return, no placement bonus In the case, multiple people end up on the same rank, the one closer to the initial East gets the higher placement The games ends if a player falls below zero points (tobi) South 4 Round doesn‚Äôt end when dealership doesn‚Äôt pass (no agariyame) Open tanyao is allowed (kuitan ari) Abortive draws for 9 unique terminals/honours in starting hand (kyuushuu kyuuhai) If you find any mistake or have more information, please get in touch. A special quirk I found is honba resetting when the dealership changes on a draw. Online Experience So far that‚Äôs just the offline and friend lobby games, both local and online.‚ÄÇHow about matched games online? For some strange reason, you can only choose between tile sets.‚ÄÇThe default rule set is East-Only with Red Dora.‚ÄÇAn option to choose between East-Only and East+South or disabling red dora would make much more sense here.‚ÄÇSince the tile set doesn‚Äôt affect the rules.‚ÄÇI hope this gets changed in a future patch. For the most part, it works just fine.‚ÄÇBut just in case you get a bad connection, navigating through the tiles can lag badly.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs inconceivable to me navigating through your hand can lag, but it‚Äôs definitely noticeable.‚ÄÇEspecially with the short time you have to choose your actions.‚ÄÇThe time for your turns are 10s + 3x10s.‚ÄÇBut!!!! You need to manually give yourself more time from your pool by pressing Y. EDIT 2020-06-05 22:40: If someone in your game disconnects they get replaced by a bot which is a big plus if you have suffered through enough diconnecting players in other platforms. EDIT 2020-06-07 16:10: If you‚Äôre the last person in a multiplayer game, the game gets cancelled instead. In Short I need to redo the other reviews with a more rigid point score.‚ÄÇThis is why instead of averaging points, I‚Äôm taking the sum. Beginner Friendliness: 5 Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) In-Game Yaku List (1) Seat Wind Indicator (1) Short Tutorial (1) Basic Usability: 3/5 Manual Extra Time (-2) Extra Usabilty: 3/5 No Auto-Win (-1) No Manual Sorting (-1) Audio: 2 Monotone, but not annoying Goodies: 2 Nintendo Phoenix Tiles (1) Disconnected players get replaced by bots (1) Sum: 16 Points Overall I actually enjoy this more than Mahjong Soul.‚ÄÇI hope to see more people playing online.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1> A Look At Riichi Mahjong in Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-06-05, last updated on 2021-07-13 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://languagetool.org/" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">LanguageTool</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small> tagged with <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/games/">Games</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/hobbies/">Hobbies</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/riichi-mahjong/">Riichi Mahjong</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/review/">Review</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/nintendo/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/nintendo-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a> </small> </div> <nav class="row mx-0 my-2"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Furiten Riichi May-hem 2020 Doman Mahjong Tournament" href="https://0xreki.github.io/doman/2020-05-furiten-riichi-may-hem/">Furiten Riichi May-hem 2020 Doman Mahjong Tournament</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Why my Software Library Looks so Random" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2020/06-06-why-my-software-library-looks-so-random">Why my Software Library Looks so Random</a> </nav> </header> <div class="row tts-controls align-items-center no-gutters pb-2"> <div class="col-4 col-md-auto mx-md-2">Text to Speech:</div> <div class="col-8 col-md mt-2 mt-md-0"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="post-content"> <!--sse--> <p>When ‚ÄúClubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics‚Äù was announced, I was hyped to hear Riichi Mahjong would be included among the games.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúI hope this is going to be good,‚Äù is what came to my mind.‚ÄÇWhy?

You need to manually give yourself more time from your pool by pressing Y.</p> <p>EDIT 2020-06-05 22:40: If someone in your game disconnects they get replaced by a bot which is a big plus if you have suffered through enough diconnecting players in other platforms.</p> <p>EDIT 2020-06-07 16:10: If you‚Äôre the last person in a multiplayer game, the game gets cancelled instead.</p> <h2 id="in-short">In Short</h2> <p>I need to redo the other reviews with a more rigid point score.‚ÄÇThis is why instead of averaging points, I‚Äôm taking the sum.</p> <ul> <li>Beginner Friendliness: 5 <ul> <li>Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) <li>In-Game Yaku List (1) <li>Seat Wind Indicator (1) <li>Short Tutorial (1) </ul> <li>Basic Usability: 3/5 <ul> <li>Manual Extra Time (-2) </ul> <li>Extra Usabilty: 3/5 <ul> <li>No Auto-Win (-1) <li>No Manual Sorting (-1) </ul> <li>Audio: 2 <ul> <li>Monotone, but not annoying </ul> <li>Goodies: 2 <ul> <li>Nintendo Phoenix Tiles (1) <li>Disconnected players get replaced by bots (1) </ul> </ul> <p>Sum: 16 Points</p> <h2 id="overall">Overall</h2> <p>I actually enjoy this more than Mahjong Soul.‚ÄÇI hope to see more people playing online.‚ÄÇ</p> <!--/sse--> </section> <footer> <nav class="row mx-0 mt-2" id="navigation" aria-flowto="comments"> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" Furiten Riichi May-hem 2020 Doman Mahjong Tournament" href="https://0xreki.github.io/doman/2020-05-furiten-riichi-may-hem/">Furiten Riichi May-hem 2020 Doman Mahjong Tournament</a> <a class="col-12 col-sm btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Why my Software Library Looks so Random" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2020/06-06-why-my-software-library-looks-so-random">Why my Software Library Looks so Random</a> </nav> <hr> <aside class="social"> </aside> </footer> </main> <footer> <div id="support"> <div class="patreon"> <p> Don't like ads?&ensp;Neither do I.&ensp;Help me keep this page ad-free!<br class="d-md-none"> <a title="Become a Patron" href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=27792463" rel="payment" class="btn btn-md btn-patreon mt-2 mt-md-0 ml-md-2"> <span> <svg viewBox="0 0 569 546" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="patreon-logo"> <g> <circle cx="362.589996" cy="204.589996" data-fill="1" id="Oval" r="204.589996"></circle> <rect data-fill="2" height="545.799988" id="Rectangle" width="100" x="0" y="0"></rect> </g> </svg> </span> <span>Become a Patron!</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> <div id="copyright" class="float-right"> <p class="text-right"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY 4.0</a> <a title="Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung" href="https://0xreki.de/about-me/">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a> <p class="text-right"> <small><a title="Privacy Statement" href="https://0xreki.github.io/privacy/">Privacy Statement</a></small> </div> </footer> <div class="policy-banner" id="policy-banner" data-nosnippet> <p> This site might use cookies to improve user experience.
