I have a tech background.‚ÄÇThat makes me have requirements to software other people might not even consider.‚ÄÇI know can‚Äôt have everything, but I‚Äôm at least allowed to nicely ask, am I not?‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs start with what I want.‚ÄÇI use Linux as my preferred operating system and Jekyll as static site generator.‚ÄÇIf there is installable software, Linux support would be very nice.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve more or less given up on that front, so I can live with just the software running in WINE. For Jekyll, I write in Markdown, so the software should parse it or at least correctly ignore Markdown.‚ÄÇFor plus points, it even ignores the front matter.‚ÄÇThat way I can just open my files and edit without needing to copy and paste text to another software and fixing the Markdown.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs nothing on this front, so this is also just a nice thing to wish for. I‚Äôm writing a Novel, so options for more natural speech and other colloquial styles would be very useful.‚ÄÇSo I get the 7-day free trial of ProWritingAid and start testing it. A Look at the Technical Matters First, some technical tests.‚ÄÇThe ProWritingAid Web Editor doesn‚Äôt have any options to style your text while writing.‚ÄÇIt feels somewhat strange after using Grammarly‚Äôs Web App.‚ÄÇThe Apps has a lot of proofing tools and options.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs always good to see options for other English variants than UK and US.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre going to use it, you‚Äôd need to put in the styles or Markdown after you‚Äôre done checking it.‚ÄÇOr just like me, use one of the other ProWritingAid Apps. Let‚Äôs continue to ProWritingAid Desktop App.‚ÄÇIt caught my eye because it claims to have support for Scrivener projects, Rich Text, Microsoft Word, Open Office, and Markdown documents.‚ÄÇMarkdown! That‚Äôs exactly what I need!‚ÄÇIt doesn‚Äôt have a Linux version, and the Windows version doesn‚Äôt run in WINE, I tried.‚ÄÇMaybe I‚Äôll have more luck with the MacOS version and darling, but that‚Äôll have to wait for later. So for testing, I run it on a Windows machine.‚ÄÇThe software looks much like the Web App,¬†but the options are in the native menu bar, making them much easier to access.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs also a word counter at the native status bar.‚ÄÇThey said Markdown so I that‚Äôs the first thing I load into the software.‚ÄÇI see I can even open a whole folder.‚ÄÇThat would make things a lot easier if my dream features work.‚ÄÇWell‚Ä¶ it just loads the file as plaintext.‚ÄÇIt treats any Markdown it encounters as interpunction and gives me interpunction mistakes.‚ÄÇSadly, I can‚Äôt even properly disable that rule.‚ÄÇAnd it doesn‚Äôt ignore the front matter!‚ÄÇJust as I get my hopes up, a big letdown‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut those were just nice to have things. Next, we have ProWritingAid Chrome Extension.‚ÄÇExtensions for other browsers exist, too. But I‚Äôm using a chromium-based browser.‚ÄÇAnd it works! So far with every editable box I had around the extension found it and did its checks. So I did some workaround for my setup.‚ÄÇI have a local testing environment anyway, so I set it up so the chapter area is editable when I‚Äôm in development mode.‚ÄÇAnd it works! Last time I tried with Grammarly, it didn‚Äôt even want to look at it.‚ÄÇYes,¬†I‚Äôm still copying the corrections to my editor.‚ÄÇBut this is only one-way now. That‚Äôs an improvement over having to copy it into Google Docs, fixing it up, and copying it back. All following tests, I did with the extension. A Look at the Proofing Options Let‚Äôs start with the thing I immediately noticed: I‚Äôm thrilled to see the extension catches all wrong closing and opening quotes.‚ÄÇYes,¬†smart quotes can be nice.‚ÄÇBut they can go horribly wrong, so I prefer manual ‚Äúcurly‚Äù quotes. With term that look similar to existing people and things, it suggests you might have mixed up the spelling.‚ÄÇI didn‚Äôt know there was a John Wentworth.‚ÄÇAnd no, the character I made is in no relation to the other guy!‚ÄÇI was just pulling out names from a list of Forenames and Surnames‚Ä¶‚ÄÇDisabling the rules about the mixup adds the name you use to your personal dictionary.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd like to add the names of all my characters and terms to that.‚ÄÇBut trying to add them manually, the website doesn‚Äôt let me enter anything with spaces, only single words. Unlike their competitor, it‚Äôs nice to see the writing styles changes the suggestions you get for your text.‚ÄÇWith hints to encourage ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù, the General style is aimed at Creative Writing.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm also thrilled about the option in the Script style to disable the suggestions about the use of passive.‚ÄÇThey have even more styles I‚Äôm not getting into.‚ÄÇProWritingAid has a nice blog post about their Writing Styles. While we‚Äôre at styles, I‚Äôd like to request a feature that checks speech with the Script style.‚ÄÇI mean it properly detects quotation marks.‚ÄÇI know I‚Äôm asking a lot. Summary It didn‚Äôt give me the Markdown support I hoped for, but it‚Äôs still good to use for creative writing.‚ÄÇWhile my dream features will are still far away, I‚Äôll be using ProWritingAid for now.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm not even through my free trial yet, and I‚Äôm already preferring ProWritingAid over Grammarly.‚ÄÇWell, if I have the money for it, that is.‚ÄÇ20 bucks is quite a lot of money for someone that writes for a hobby.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1> A Look At ProWritingAid </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2020-10-12, last
