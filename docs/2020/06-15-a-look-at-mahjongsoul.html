A Quick Analysis of the Freemium Over the last decade or so, I got a habit when starting F2P games: I check premium stuff first.‚ÄÇFirst, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy power,¬†a.‚ÄØk.‚ÄØa.¬†pay to win.‚ÄÇSince we‚Äôre talking about a mahjong game here, that should be a non-issue.‚ÄÇBut I should be wary of it. Secondly, it should be reasonably possible to get everything you could pay premium currency for by playing the game.‚ÄÇThe hard thing here is consenting to what‚Äôs reasonable and what‚Äôs not reasonable.‚ÄÇAnd sadly, MahjongSoul already lets me down here. Well, let‚Äôs go the for easy route first: no, you can‚Äôt buy Jade for Coppers.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs not a minus per se, but that would have been the easiest way to clear this analysis.‚ÄÇSo let‚Äôs look at the thing everyone wants: summoning a new character.‚ÄÇTo do that you need 200 Jade, which is about USD 3.40 (USD 1.20, if you factor in the first purchase bonus).‚ÄÇCompared to that, you need 50 Stardust, the freemium currency. How do you get those?‚ÄÇBy donating your items.‚ÄÇBuying those of items costs you 15,000 Coppers in the in-game shop, and you need 50 of those for a single summoning scroll.‚ÄÇThat makes 750,000 Coppers for a single summon attempt.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt forget that‚Äôs just an attempt and not a guaranteed summon. So how hard is it to get 750,000 Coppers?‚ÄÇLet‚Äôs say we can consistently win hanchan in the Gold Room, the middle range room, with +30 post uma.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôd be 4,200 Coppers minus 1,400 Coppers entry fee, so it‚Äôs a net gain of 2,800 Coppers.‚ÄÇSo we‚Äôd ‚Äúonly‚Äù need to win 288 hanchan in Gold Room.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre saying you gain more coppers in the highest room, I ran the numbers there, too.‚ÄÇYes,¬†it‚Äôs a smaller number of games you need to win there: you just need to win 750,000‚Äâ√∑‚Äâ(30‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ80 ‚àí 2800)‚Äâ=‚Äâ134¬†hanchan in the Throne Room.‚ÄÇEasy, isn‚Äôt it?‚ÄÇLooking at these numbers, I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs not reasonably possible to get everything you could buy with a Jade by earning Copper.‚ÄÇSo the premium aspect of this game is a big minus. Granted, starting in Silver Room you can get free items playing, but even these did double the amount of items you get, it‚Äôs still too slow.‚ÄÇPlus, you are limited to 5 scrolls; no indication when I can get more.‚ÄÇThey get reset from time to time.‚ÄÇAnd you tend to get free summons from time to time.‚ÄÇBut it‚Äôs still not enough if you‚Äôre not lucky.‚ÄÇAs I said, that‚Äôs just an attempt, there‚Äôs no guarantee you even get a character. The Visual Experience at the Table This game has nice animations.‚ÄÇDora have a glowing animation on them.‚ÄÇAmong the cosmetics, assuming you can afford them, you can have different table cloths, tile backs, riichi sticks, hands and animations.‚ÄÇThis game definitely one of the nicest looking ones. The information you need is neatly in the centre of the screen and below dora indicator, which you can find at the top left.‚ÄÇThe wall is not displayed at all.‚ÄÇThe hand options are to the left: automatic sorting (A), auto win (R), disable non-winning calls (C), auto discard (D).‚ÄÇThe arrow would show what the letters mean. When you hover above a tile in your hand, the same tiles that are already on the table get highlighted.‚ÄÇWhen you are tenpai, the exclamation mark appears to the right.‚ÄÇClicking on it or hovering over the correct tile to discard reveals your waits and the number of tiles left.‚ÄÇThey even warn you if you‚Äôd be furiten or don‚Äôt have any yaku for that wait. The Audio Experience Now,¬†to the sounds and music.‚ÄÇI wish I could say something nice about this.‚ÄÇOh,¬†I can: the background music is calming at first.‚ÄÇThen it just gets repetitive and annoying.‚ÄÇThe same goes for the cat girl Ichihime.‚ÄÇShe is cute for the first few games.‚ÄÇHer ‚Äúnyaas‚Äù in the calls and yaku names are cute at first.‚ÄÇBut you tire of them very quickly.‚ÄÇAnd it gets annoying very fast, too. Sure, you can disable the sounds.‚ÄÇBut if I have to do that, it just proves how terrible it is. Scoring of a Hand Scoring is as you would expect.‚ÄÇIf you have levelled the bond with your character, the character with a complete portrait shot reads the yaku ‚Äî plus can unlock their alternate costume. It took them damn way too long to add in some male characters.‚ÄÇBut they also have added more fan service.‚ÄÇPeople‚Ä¶ if you want to see porn, do watch porn.‚ÄÇI just want to play Mahjong without that‚Ä¶ I digress. Stuff for Beginners As I said before, the game throws you into quite a decent tutorial. If you aren‚Äôt proficient with the Chinese numerals, you can enable the little numbers in the corner in the options of the main menu only.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not a real problem, you can‚Äôt turn them on during a hand since they are enabled by default.‚ÄÇAnd you have to actively turn them off. Oh yes, before I forget, you can open the list of yaku anytime with the options at the top right of the screen. Disconnects So I got very infuriated with disconnecting players.‚ÄÇIn low lobbies, in about one every third game so far, someone disconnected.‚ÄÇIt does happen, yes, that‚Äôs just how it is with online games.‚ÄÇBut hell, in the few days it happened well too often. Aside from a message in the announcement, I haven‚Äôt seen anything to either penalize people who disconnect because they have a bad run or the anything to make the game go on normally.‚ÄÇI mean, today, I even got 2 people disconnecting in a hanchan.‚ÄÇIt was quite a farm for me.‚ÄÇBut if I was my toimen, I‚Äôd have been swearing a lot in this game.‚ÄÇLuckily for both of us, we managed to tobi one of the players that left.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a big part of my frustration with the game.‚ÄÇIt gets better the higher you get, but it‚Äôs still an issue. And after seeing how Nintendo handles disconnects in Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics this feels just so‚Ä¶ backwards.‚ÄÇAnd people usually accuse Nintendo of being backwards. In Short Beginner Friendliness: 5 Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) In-Game Yaku List (1) Seat Wind Indicator (1) Short Tutorial (1) Basic Usability: 5 Extra Usability: 5 Audio: 0 Monotone, gets annoying fast Goodies: 1 Nice Visuals: 1 Baddies: Endless Disconnects of Other Players: -3 Sexualization of Characters: -3 Sum: 10 If you don‚Äôt mind the freemium, the cat girl, the repetitive background music and the fact players seem to be leaving games a lot in this game is for you. It is a solid client.‚ÄÇBut the characters are a problem.‚ÄÇAnd don‚Äôt get me started with the oversexualization of underage characters. If you do mind mentioned things, better look for something else.

with your character, the character with a complete portrait shot reads the yaku ‚Äî plus can unlock their alternate costume.</p> <p>It took them damn way too long to add in some male characters.‚ÄÇBut they also have added more fan service.‚ÄÇPeople‚Ä¶ if you want to see porn, do watch porn.‚ÄÇI just want to play Mahjong without that‚Ä¶ I digress.</p> <h2 id="stuff-for-beginners">Stuff for Beginners</h2> <p>As I said before, the game throws you into quite a decent tutorial.</p> <p>If you aren‚Äôt proficient with the Chinese numerals, you can enable the little numbers in the corner in the options of the main menu only.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not a real problem, you can‚Äôt turn them on during a hand since they are enabled by default.‚ÄÇAnd you have to actively turn them off.</p> <p>Oh yes, before I forget, you can open the list of yaku anytime with the options at the top right of the screen.</p> <h3 id="disconnects">Disconnects</h3> <p>So I got very infuriated with disconnecting players.‚ÄÇIn low lobbies, in about one every third game so far, someone disconnected.‚ÄÇIt does happen, yes, that‚Äôs just how it is with online games.‚ÄÇBut hell, in the few days it happened well too often.</p> <p>Aside from a message in the announcement, I haven‚Äôt seen anything to either penalize people who disconnect because they have a bad run or the anything to make the game go on normally.‚ÄÇI mean, today, I even got 2 people disconnecting in a <abbr title="East and South">hanchan</abbr>.‚ÄÇIt was quite a farm for me.‚ÄÇBut if I was my <abbr title="player across the table">toimen</abbr>, I‚Äôd have been swearing a lot in this game.‚ÄÇLuckily for both of us, we managed to <abbr title="bankrupt">tobi</abbr> one of the players that left.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs a big part of my frustration with the game.‚ÄÇIt gets better the higher you get, but it‚Äôs still an issue.</p> <p>And after seeing how Nintendo handles disconnects in <a href="/2020/06-05-a-look-at-riichi-mahjong-in-clubhouse-games-51-worldwide-classics/">Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</a> this feels just so‚Ä¶ backwards.‚ÄÇAnd people usually accuse Nintendo of being backwards.</p> <h2 id="in-short">In Short</h2> <ul> <li>Beginner Friendliness: 5 <ul> <li>Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) <li>In-Game Yaku List (1) <li>Seat Wind Indicator (1) <li>Short Tutorial
