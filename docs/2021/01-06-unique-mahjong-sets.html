Unique sets go ‚Äúsimple‚Äù branding to completely changing the look and/or rules.‚ÄÇThe most lazy change is just putting some branding onto the back of the tiles.‚ÄÇBut to me, those are also the most boring ones ‚Äî changes in the tile faces feel more artistic to me. This post will focus heavily Ichikawaya sets.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not sponsored, but they‚Äôre the only place I know that makes such sets in Riichi format.‚ÄÇAs such, this list is not exhaustive, and I will only go ever sets I have a personal interest in.‚ÄÇIf you know of other place to reliably find such sets, please get in touch. Crabs and Gold Fish Set by Ichikawaya Let‚Äôs begin with a very ancient set: Crabs and Gold Fish Set by Ichikawaya.‚ÄÇMy Japanese is close to non-existent but Google Translate tells me it‚Äôs a reproduction of an antique set.‚ÄÇThe pinzu in this set are crabs while the souzu are gold fish.‚ÄÇSure, green souzu isn‚Äôt green, but everything about this set says it‚Äôs from a prior era and high class. Tengen Set by Ichikawaya The Tengen Set by Ichikawaya is currently the set I‚Äôm thinking of buying in the near future.‚ÄÇIt has a classy look that doesn‚Äôt feel old. Galaxy Set by Ichikawaya One of most changed sets I‚Äôm eyeing from time to time is the Galaxy Set by Ichikawaya.‚ÄÇIt doesn‚Äôt look like any other Mahjong Set I‚Äôve ever seen.‚ÄÇIn this set, Pinzu are planets, manzu have the man symbol replaced by planet symbols, and souzu are all star constellations.‚ÄÇTo stay in the theme, red fives are replaced by blue fives.‚ÄÇThe winds are just simple letters, E S W and N.‚ÄÇThe dragons are the western zodiac signs divided into 3 groups of the same colour.‚ÄÇFlowers and seasons are more symbols that are used in Astrology.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs such different take on tiles I‚Äôd consider it more a collectable than an actual set to play. Doman Mahjong Set from Final Fantasy XIV Of course, there‚Äôs the Doman Mahjong Set from Final Fanatsy XIV (US Shop Link) (EU Shop Link).‚ÄÇPinpu in this set are Namazu, souzu are Sabotender, and the manzu are with stylized arabic numbers.‚ÄÇThe only problem is some of those numbers also look like Katakana and might throw you for a loop. (Damn you, Kupti Koop!) If not for the ongoing pandemic, this set is widely available, so I decided to make this my go-to set for teaching mahjong to people that just want to get an initial look at it. MACHILL Set by THE 90s LAB Stepping away from Riichi tiles, I recently found the MACHILL Set by THE 90s LAB.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs very modern and simplistic.‚ÄÇThe only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is it has white back.‚ÄÇAnyway, I can‚Äôt find it anywhere, so even if I would want to buy it, I currently can‚Äôt. The Minimal Line by The Mahjong Line Finally, I just found a minimalistic set from the west, The Minimal Line by The Mahjong Line.‚ÄÇI would very much like to link that set, but there was some outrage about alleged ‚Äúgentrification of Mahjong‚Äù.‚ÄÇSo Asians can do whatever they want and it‚Äôs a unique Mahjong set, but when 3 White women do it, it‚Äôs called gentrification?!‚ÄÇAs one would expect of the internet outcry machine in the early 20s, some hacked the site and wiped it.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs quite a bummer, I like the look of the Minimal Line.‚ÄÇ400 bucks might have been too steep of price for me.‚ÄÇBut I can still admire its looks.‚ÄÇThe set looks nice, but if I have to nitpick, the flowers and seasons aren‚Äôt numbered and not easily divided in sets.‚ÄÇBut that‚Äôs only problem if you actually plan to use this to play a variant that needs those with numbers and in two sets.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs most likely the creators only intended this for American Mahjong.‚ÄÇYes,¬†American Mahjong, it exists.‚ÄÇIn fact, it has existed for so long it has diverted a lot from Chinese Mahjong, which apparently is centuries old, at least, according to most news sites are FOMO‚Äôing in on the outrage.‚ÄÇThe oldest record of its existence are from the late 19th century, 1870 to 1890, I believe that‚Äôs way too young to be called ‚Äúcenturies‚Äù old.‚ÄÇBy the way, American Mahjong was created in the 1920s. So I‚Äôd like to give the creators constructive input to consider that in their next design.‚ÄÇOh wait, the outrage machine made them shut down‚Ä¶ this is why we can‚Äôt have nice things. EDIT: The site wasn‚Äôt purged intentionally by the owners, so I can even link to their product! Daisuchi Set by Taiyo Chemicals This was to be the end of my little list, but meanwhile the camp that actually enjoys nice things pointed me to another Riichi Set: ah, Asia and their love of puns!‚ÄÇThe Big Sushi Set by Taiyo Chemicals replaces all the common elements with rice, fish and seaweed.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1> Unique Mahjong Sets: Art or Gentrification? </h1> <div
