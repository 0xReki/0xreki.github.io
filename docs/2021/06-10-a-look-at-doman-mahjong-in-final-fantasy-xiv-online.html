Final Fantasy XIV First, let‚Äôs get the basics down: Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 where you usually need to both purchase the game and have an active subscription.‚ÄÇBut if you‚Äôre only interested in Mahjong, rejoice: you can play using the time-unlimited trial account.‚ÄÇYou don‚Äôt need to pay at all.‚ÄÇGranted, there are some restrictions in place,¬†e.‚ÄØg.,¬†not being able to use tells,¬†a.‚ÄØk.‚ÄØa.¬†whisper to someone or not being able to invite other players to join your party.‚ÄÇThose restrictions might be a hindrance to playing mahjong.‚ÄÇMore of that later. Regardless of what account type you have, you need to make your way through the Main Scenario Quest ‚ÄúThe Ul‚Äôdahn Envoy‚Äù.‚ÄÇAfter that, you can unlock the Gold Saucer with the quest ‚ÄúIt Could Happen To You‚Äù.‚ÄÇNow you unlock Doman Mahjong with the quest ‚ÄúEvery Little Thing She Does Is Mahjong‚Äù.‚ÄÇAfter that, you can play Mahjong by queuing using the Duty Finder.‚ÄÇOr you can play bot games using the NPC tables in the Gold Saucer. The Visual Experience at the Table The Mahjong game has barely any animations at all.‚ÄÇDrawing, discarding and calling have the minimum amount of animation of them, so you can see what is happening.‚ÄÇThere are very few customization options: choosing the tile set and the layout. You can choose between the default set, the Doman Tile Set,¬†which is a Final Fantasy XIV themed set, and the Classic Tile Set,¬†which is what you would call a normal set.‚ÄÇThe Doman Set has stylized Arabic Numbers for manzu, Namazu for pinzu and Sabotender for souzu.‚ÄÇPersonally, I like the look of most tiles of the set, I just don‚Äôt like stylized Arabic Numbers.‚ÄÇPeople that are proficient in Japanese can happen to actually see katakana instead of numbers. In 2020, SquareEnix put their set into their merchandise lineup.‚ÄÇI immediately ordered it, but due to COVID-19, it took till February 2021 to arrive.‚ÄÇIf you‚Äôre interested to procure it yourself, check out the respective store pages. Doman Mahjong Set from Final Fantasy XIV (US Shop Link) Doman Mahjong Set from Final Fantasy XIV (EU Shop Link). No matter if you choose the Standard layout or the High Resolution layout, the information you need is spread over the screen.‚ÄÇSome information is redundant due to that. In the default configuration, the current dora, not the dora indicator, are displayed on the top right, just below the current deal number.‚ÄÇIt might take a while to get used or unused to it.‚ÄÇFinal Fantasy calls this dora indicator setting ‚ÄúDoman Mahjong‚Äù.‚ÄÇIn the 5.4 update, the option to Traditional, which show the previous tile as the indicator.2 The wall is not displayed at all.‚ÄÇThe hand options are to the bottom right: disable non-winning calls, auto win, hints, dangerous tile markers, tile names, and chat. Since patch 5.4, when called, the called tile is reddened, leaving a ghost tile.2 Before that, a called tile was grey out, also leaving a ghost tile.‚ÄÇThe new meaning of grey tiles are they were discarded immediately after being drawn (tsumogiri discard). There is no warning if you might get into furiten when dropping a tile.‚ÄÇBut it does say that you are in furiten as you are had become so. In the visuals, there is one quirk I notice: there is no distinction between a called kan (daiminkan) and a kan extended from an open pon (shouminkan).‚ÄÇIn the former case, there should only be one tile put horizontally, hence why it‚Äôs called a daiminkan, a big open quad.‚ÄÇIn the latter case, there are two tiles but horizontally, hence why it‚Äôs called a shouminkan, a small open quad.‚ÄÇHere in Doman Mahjong, all kans have the form of a shouminkan, even closed ones. The Audio Experience Now,¬†to the sounds and music.‚ÄÇThe background music is calming, though very stereotypical.‚ÄÇBut after hours of playing, it gets boring to annoying.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd love an option to set the music to any music from the Orchestrion, the Final Fantasy XIV in-game jukebox. The calls aren‚Äôt voiced; they don‚Äôt need to.‚ÄÇThat way, you can‚Äôt get annoyed by voices you don‚Äôt like.‚ÄÇThe calls instead get a nice short sound effect. Scoring of a Hand Scoring is as you would expect.‚ÄÇNow might be a good time to mention there are no replays.‚ÄÇSo if you want to share your big hand, you need to screenshot it immediately.‚ÄÇThe translations are interesting as well‚Ä¶‚ÄÇBut then, there‚Äôs no real standard for it. Stuff for Beginners There‚Äôs no proper introduction, and reading the in game guide to Mahjong doesn‚Äôt help much.‚ÄÇThere‚Äôs no in-game list of yaku. If you‚Äôre unsure about tile efficiency, you can enable hints which will show directly above the hand options.‚ÄÇWhich would be a great plus for beginner friendliness if there was a proper tutorial for the game.‚ÄÇAlso, if you‚Äôre not good a reading the river, you can enable the dangerous tiles marker.‚ÄÇWhich would mark all the dangerous tiles with red and orange marks. If you aren‚Äôt proficient with the Chinese numerals, you can enable tile names which you display the tile names on your tiles in your hand when you hover over them.‚ÄÇBut sadly only for the tiles in your hand and only if it‚Äôs your turn.‚ÄÇAlternatively, you can always use the aforementioned Doman set, which has stylized Arabian Numbers that do look like Asian characters. Rule Sets Let‚Äôs have a look at the Mahjong rooms: since the 5.4 update, there two game lengths: Quick Match, which is a tonpuusen, and Full Game, which is a hanchan, not an iichan.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs how they decided to translate it, don‚Äôt question it.‚ÄÇBefore the update, there were only hanchan possible. Each game length has 4 rooms: there are two unranked rooms which are only accessible with a Light Party,¬†i.‚ÄØe.,¬†you have a group of four.‚ÄÇThe two room differ in only one rule: kuitan disabled or kuitan enabled.‚ÄÇIf you are on a free Trial Account, you can‚Äôt invite people to a party, but you can join one.‚ÄÇYou might be limited by that.‚ÄÇBut that should be just a minor inconvenience, and who but people that I teach to play mahjong and the people that play in my Doman Mahjong tournaments use these rooms? Then, there are two ranked rooms: Novice and Advanced.‚ÄÇYou need to be 1st Dan or higher to enter Advanced games.‚ÄÇThough due to the relative small player base no one ever queues for Advanced games which can make games quite frustrating for higher ranked players, more about that later. Other than aforementioned differences, all rooms use the same rules: 3 red fives (aka ari) players start on 25,000 points no return, no placement bonus hanchan ends if a player falls below zero points (tobi) South 4 Round also ends when dealership doesn‚Äôt pass (agariyame) open tanyao is allowed (kuitan ari) 13 han and above is a kazoe yakuman cumulative single yakuman double ron allowed, no head bump abortive draws for 9 unique terminals/honours in starting hand (kyuushuu kyuuhai) 3 same wind tile as the first 4 discards (suufonsu renda) 3 4 kan not from the same person (suukaikan) and 3 triple ron (sancha hou) 3 no abortive draw for 4 riichi (suucha riichi) mangan at draw (nagashi mangan) possible 4 The Problems Earlier, I said no one plays in the Advanced rooms.‚ÄÇThat seems fine, people can just play in Novice rooms, but that has a big drawback that everyone seems to accept: if a 1st dan player looses against three 4th dan players in the novice room, they lose about a lot of ranking points.‚ÄÇEven getting 2nd might result in you losing ranking points there.‚ÄÇAlso, playing an unranked game requires your to put together your own Light Party.‚ÄÇAs mentioned above, that might be impossible.‚ÄÇFortunately, players just organize themselves for this. You might want to check out the various communities for that. Mahjong of Light Discord (DC: Light) FFXIV Mahjong Discord (US DCs) In Short Beginner Friendliness: 4 Beginner Friendly Tiles (2) Seat Wind Indicator (1) Robust Guide &amp; Dangerous Tiles Markers (1) Useless Tutorial (0) Basic Usability: 4/5 Information Spread Throughout the Screen (-1) Extra Usability: 4/5 No Manual Sorting (-1) Audio: 1 Monotone, stereotypical Asian, gets annoying after a while Goodies:1 Final Fantasy XIV Tiles (1) Sum: 13 Points Overall Based on the resources for players in game, I still can‚Äôt recommend playing Doman Mahjong to players how want to get into Riichi Mahjong.‚ÄÇBut if you‚Äôre already into Riichi Mahjong, Doman Mahjong is a good Riichi client embedded into an MMO where you have fun playing games.‚ÄÇIf you still want to try, do get in touch with the discords I mentioned above.‚ÄÇThey‚Äôll help.‚ÄÇMaybe join one of my tournaments. Edits I got the date wrong, patch 4.5 was on 2019-01-07, not 2019-07-01. Of course, Doman Mahjong has akadora, I wonder what happened to my notes‚Ä¶ Added in the actual number of akadora.

differ in only one rule: kuitan disabled or kuitan enabled.‚ÄÇIf you are on a free Trial Account, you can‚Äôt invite people to a party, but you can join one.‚ÄÇYou might be limited by that.‚ÄÇBut that should be just a minor inconvenience, and who but people that I teach to play mahjong and the people that play in <a href="/doman/">my Doman Mahjong tournaments</a> use these rooms?</p> <p>Then, there are two ranked rooms: Novice and Advanced.‚ÄÇYou need to be 1st Dan or higher to enter Advanced games.‚ÄÇThough due to the relative small player base no one ever queues for Advanced games which can make games quite frustrating for higher ranked players, more about that later.</p> <p>Other than aforementioned differences, all rooms use the same rules:</p> <ul> <li>3 red fives (aka ari) <li>players <strong>start on 25,000 points</strong> <li>no return, no placement bonus <li><abbr title="East and South game">hanchan</abbr> <strong>ends</strong> if a player falls <strong>below zero points</strong> (<abbr title="bankrupt">tobi</abbr>) <li>South 4 Round also ends when dealership doesn‚Äôt pass (agariyame) <li>open tanyao is allowed (kuitan ari) <li>13 han and above is a kazoe yakuman <li>cumulative single yakuman <li>double ron allowed, no head bump <li>abortive draws for <ul> <li>9 unique terminals/honours in starting hand (kyuushuu kyuuhai) <sup

no one plays in the Advanced rooms.‚ÄÇThat seems fine, people can just play in Novice rooms, but that has a big drawback that everyone seems to accept: if a 1st dan player looses against three 4th dan players in the novice room, they lose about a lot of ranking points.‚ÄÇEven getting 2nd might result in you losing ranking points there.‚ÄÇAlso, playing an unranked game requires your to put together your own Light Party.‚ÄÇAs mentioned above, that might be impossible.‚ÄÇFortunately, players just organize themselves for this.</p> <p>You might want to check out the various communities for that.</p>

can‚Äôt recommend playing Doman Mahjong to players how want to get into Riichi Mahjong.‚ÄÇBut if you‚Äôre already into Riichi Mahjong, Doman Mahjong is a good Riichi client embedded into an MMO where you have fun playing games.‚ÄÇIf you still want to try, do get in touch with the discords I mentioned above.‚ÄÇThey‚Äôll help.‚ÄÇMaybe join one of my tournaments.</p> <aside> <h2>Edits</h2> <ul> <li>I
