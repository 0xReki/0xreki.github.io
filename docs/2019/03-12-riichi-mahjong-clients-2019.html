Desktop Clients Tenhou (Â§©È≥≥) Desktop Tenhou is still the go-to client and the one software every other Riichi Mahjong client is compared to.‚ÄÇIt has clients in Flash and HTML5 to run in any compatible browser and a native client for Windows.‚ÄÇAlthough it is only available in Japanese there is an extension for Firefox and Chromium-based browsers that translates the HTML5 version to English and French.‚ÄÇTenhou is very playable even without a premium subscription. All the information about the deal is in the center.‚ÄÇThe dora indicators are in the wall as you expect. Final Fantasy XIV Online While Final Fantasy XIV Online itself is not a Riichi Mahjong client, it has real multiplayer Riichi Mahjong to play in it: it‚Äôs called Doman Mahjong.‚ÄÇYou can find it in the Gold Saucer, which you can access quite soon in the story.‚ÄÇSo soon, that in fact if you only want to play Mahjong you can just get the free trial, which is unlimited in time. Since Final Fantasy XIV Online is a multilingual MMO even the Mahjong game is translated to several languages.‚ÄÇAnd I think it‚Äôs the most beginner friendly client. You cannot see the wall.‚ÄÇInstead, you see the remaining tile count in the center.‚ÄÇIn the top right corner, you see the information about the current deal and the doras.‚ÄÇNote you really see the doras, not the indicators like you would see in a real-life game. In the bottom right corner, you have hints: it tells you what to discard to best tile efficiency.‚ÄÇThen, near the end of a deal or after somebody calls Riichi there are the Dangerous Tile Markers: red means very dangerous, orange dangerous etc.‚ÄÇSafe tiles are not marked. Called tiles are not removed, instead, they become darkened ‚Äúghost tiles‚Äù. Square Enix has their own tileset ‚Äî Doman.‚ÄÇI think it looks neat.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd buy it if it was a good set that were available to buy, but it was only given away in a niconico raffle for Japanese only.‚ÄÇIt features Cactuar for souzu and Namazu for pinzu and stylized Roman Numerals for manzu.‚ÄÇBut unfortunately, those are not without problems: for people who can read Japanese those stylized numbers look like real characters resulting in some confusion.‚ÄÇOK, it is obvious when you see them in the sorted with other manzu, but when you encounter them in isolation you get this: ‚Äúno man? fu man?‚Äù referring to the strange looking 1 man and 7 man respectively.‚ÄÇGood thing you can simply switch the tileset to traditional in the Gold Saucer options. All in all, I think Square Enix has done a great job of making Riichi Mahjong accessible to new players. SEGA NET Mahjong MJ („Çª„Ç¨NETÈ∫ªÈõÄ MJ) SEGA NET Mahjong MJ is another client I commonly use.‚ÄÇIt is Japanese language only. You cannot see the wall, but you can see dora indicator in the top left corner.‚ÄÇDoras turn all golden. All information about the current deal is in the center.‚ÄÇI especially like the fact you can discard tiles using the keyboard.‚ÄÇThe default game rules are quick games.‚ÄÇAlthough those can be changed. OpenRiichi If you‚Äôre like me you think: ‚ÄúWith Riichi so big, there certainly must be an open source client somewhere‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄÇI found OpenRiichi.‚ÄÇOne the first look it seems decent.‚ÄÇI do quite like how it looks.‚ÄÇBut looking at it more you can see it has very major flaws. While in other clients I discussed till now you can easily see what the current deal,¬†e.‚ÄØg.,¬†East‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ4, this client does not properly display it.‚ÄÇYou might assume you can infer the deal from the position of the dealer in relation to the chicha marker on the table.‚ÄÇBut unfortunately, that marker moves with the dealer making it impossible to infer the current deal from just looking at the table.‚ÄÇWhile I would add that as an issue on the GitHub project, it seems (as of March 2019) that project is abandoned. Mobile Clients Tenhou (Â§©È≥≥) Mobile Of course, Tenhou runs on mobile.‚ÄÇBasically, it‚Äôs just the HTML5 client packaged into an app.‚ÄÇSince extensions don‚Äôt run on mobile you are stuck with a Japanese interface. SEGA NET Mahjong MJ („Çª„Ç¨NETÈ∫ªÈõÄ MJ) SEGA NET Mahjong MJ also has apps for mobiles. Minna no Mahjong („Åø„Çì„Å™„ÅÆÈ∫ªÈõÄ) Minna no Mahjong used to be good single player client. It only has a Japanese interface.‚ÄÇIt has good AI players. It looks great. So why do I hate it?‚ÄÇIf you want to play more than 3 hanchan per day you have to pay.‚ÄÇI can‚Äôt read Japanese.‚ÄÇBut interpreting the UI after the limiting update it doesn‚Äôt look like I just buy premium once and play whenever I want.‚ÄÇIt looks more like buying a recharge for freemium mobile games. R R is not released yet.‚ÄÇI will post an update on this. Eventually.
