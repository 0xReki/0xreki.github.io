Let‚Äôs start with the first reason: the process of installing updates is annoying.‚ÄÇYou have to interrupt whatever you are doing with your device and update.‚ÄÇAt least you can choose when it happens.‚ÄÇAutomatic updates make even it worse: they just interrupt you whenever the system feels like it.‚ÄÇAnd by Murphy‚Äôs Law,¬†the system always feels like it when you least need it.‚ÄÇLike when you have been writing for hours and haven‚Äôt saved your progress at all.‚ÄÇOr when you are having an important Guild vs. Guild match.‚ÄÇWhy is that a problem?‚ÄÇE.‚ÄØg.¬†for Windows Updates installing them entails rebooting once or twice.‚ÄÇAnd for some reason, Microsoft thought it to be a good idea to default to restarting if the user didn‚Äôt react to a message resulting in many reboots with very bad timing.‚ÄÇWith some other software, it just hogs so many resources it disrupts whatever you were doing.‚ÄÇSoftware companies slowly realized that‚Äôs a problem and make it better.‚ÄÇBut the damage is already done.‚ÄÇOver time, frustrated users have already started to disable updates.‚ÄÇAnd they will not reenable them if they can help it. Another reason is updates that improve user experience.‚ÄÇWhile it might sound like a good idea, after all this time, reading ‚Äúimprove user experience‚Äù just means one of two things: on a console that‚Äôs just another update designed to hinder the execution of homebrew, user-written software for consoles.‚ÄÇOn a PC that just means they‚Äôre again moving some buttons around and I need to waste my time finding where the button I need has gone and getting used to it new place again.‚ÄÇJust so it might move somewhere else with the next update.‚ÄÇOver time, I have come to appreciate stable UI and command-line tools that are primarily designed for script execution so it doesn‚Äôt change much with updates saving me a lot of time in the process.‚ÄÇIt is quite ironic if typing in up to 160 characters can be much faster than searching for a damn button that does the same thing.‚ÄÇBut unlike most users, I‚Äôm tech-savvy.‚ÄÇSo here as well, frustrated users started to disable updates so they can stop wasting time. Another big reason is the fact that updates don‚Äôt necessarily stick to their promise of fixing issues and/or adding new features.‚ÄÇInstead, they actively break that promise.‚ÄÇAt times updates just make the system even more unstable.‚ÄÇWhy on earth would I update if all it does is crash my system, sometimes to the point that I have to reinstall everything?! The fact that some companies just keep pushing unstable updates to their customers, just makes it a high-risk low reward gamble with every single update.‚ÄÇSo again, disabling updates seems to be a better choice.‚ÄÇBut then, a certain company just decided instead of pushing stable updates, they just enforce automatic updates.‚ÄÇWell done, Microsoft!‚ÄÇYou are just the worst.‚ÄÇStop using your Home Edition users as beta testers! And there‚Äôs the problem that an update might remove a feature from the software or even add an anti-feature.‚ÄÇYou have never seen it happen?‚ÄÇSony‚Äôs removal of Another OS on PlayStation 3 is a good example.‚ÄÇI even had an instrument tuning app on my mobile where a feature was removed due to patent trolling.‚ÄÇOr like how the current version of Skype is infested with ads.‚ÄÇI could go on and on‚Ä¶ point is it happens.‚ÄÇAnd the only solution seems to be, again, not updating. So why would you want to update if all it does is very likely to ruin your day?‚ÄÇOn a console, you are simply barred from using new software if you refuse to update.‚ÄÇOn a PC, getting infected with malware just ruins your day even a lot more.‚ÄÇAnd the only way to stop that is installing updates.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1> Why People Hate Updating Their Software </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata"
