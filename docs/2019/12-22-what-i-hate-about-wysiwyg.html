What is WYSIWYG? WYSIWYG is an acronym for ‚ÄúWhat You See Is What You Get‚Äù.‚ÄÇThe idea is in the name.‚ÄÇA common wordprocessor is a typical case of a WYSIWYG editor.‚ÄÇBut there are problems, lots of them. You don‚Äôt get what you see! Yes, most of the times, you usually don‚Äôt get what you see.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs just how things are.‚ÄÇWhen you can try to make sure it‚Äôs close enough that‚Äôs not much of a problem.‚ÄÇSometimes you even want the product to look different,¬†e.‚ÄØg.¬†eBooks need to able to reflow. But the problems start when the product deviates when it shouldn‚Äôt.‚ÄÇFixing those problems is in the range from easy in a few click up to impossible.‚ÄÇWhy? Because you don‚Äôt have that much control over it. You don‚Äôt have control Part of being a techie is being somewhat in control.‚ÄÇAnd a non-behaving WYSIWYG editor is the opposite of being in control.‚ÄÇOK, part of the problem is people not properly using the tools they have.‚ÄÇStaying with word processors, people aligning text manually using spaces and newlines‚Ä¶‚ÄÇPeople not using headers, but instead manually styling text to look like it etc.‚ÄÇTo help with that modern software just makes guesses what you actually want to do which can go horribly wrong as well. But even if you do use it properly you still run into problems when you don‚Äôt have control.‚ÄÇA typical problem I run into is adding in text after a link.‚ÄÇUsually, the text I add becomes part of the link.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs not what I wanted! Some features are impossible with WYSIWYG Yes, some features are impossible with WYSIWYG.‚ÄÇIt might be possible with more professional software, but then you would need to learn to use that software!‚ÄÇNot to mention getting access to that software. Do you want custom JavaScript in a certain Web Page?‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs not that easy.‚ÄÇAt that point you‚Äôre off to work on some low level stuff which the editor might just discard‚Ä¶‚ÄÇAssuming, of course, you even have that possibility‚Ä¶ WYSIWYM! WYSIWYM ‚Äî What You See Is What You Mean ‚Äî is not the be all and end all.‚ÄÇFirst, you need to be able to express yourself for the computer to understand what you want.‚ÄÇSo it‚Äôs back to able able to use the tools. Plus, you need to able to get your head around separating content from view ‚Äî something that is not that easy to get into. Some things are just bound to certain content, like links. Markdown seems like a good thing.‚ÄÇAs a techie it just feels natural to me.‚ÄÇNot too complex as writing HTML or LaTex but powerful enough for lots of things.‚ÄÇWith Attribute List support you even can have the extra control you need it.‚ÄÇBut not all people feel like that. Sometimes, using a WYSIWYG editor is just better.‚ÄÇUsually, if you project is small or simple, WYSIWYG editor is just fine, and faster.‚ÄÇIf I need to hang a simple sign I don‚Äôt start a LaTeX document or some fancy design software I just use a simple word processor.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1 aria-hidden> What I hate about WYSIWYG </h1> <div class="d-none" id="talkify-title" aria-flowto="talkify-metadata"> <p>0xReki's Adventures by Night<p> <p>What I hate about WYSIWYG<p> </div> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left"> published on 2019-12-22, last updated on 2021-06-12 </small> <small class="float-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div class="clearfix"></div> <small> tagged with <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/text-processing/">Text Processing</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/markdown/">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/rants/">Rants</a> </small> </div> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 mt-2"> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" What I hate about Games in 2019" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2019/11-22-what-i-hate-about-games-in-2019">What I hate about Games in 2019</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="Blog Technology 2020" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2020/05-22-blog-technology-2020">Blog Technology 2020</a> <nav> </header> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="post-content"> <!--sse--> <p>This blog seems like it‚Äôs turning into ‚ÄúThings I Hate‚Äù‚Ä¶ Whatever‚Ä¶</p> <p>So I was posting chapters of my Web Novel <a href="/crystaldown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crystal Down</a> to <a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/series/75079/crystal-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribble Hub</a> when I ran into a wall that is the WYSIWYG Editor they have.‚ÄÇI was not exactly over the moon to learn they don‚Äôt have a non-WYSIWYG alternative.‚ÄÇWhy do hate that?</p> <h2 id="what-is-wysiwyg">What is WYSIWYG?</h2> <p>WYSIWYG is an acronym for ‚ÄúWhat You See Is What You Get‚Äù.‚ÄÇThe idea is in the name.‚ÄÇA common wordprocessor is a typical case of a WYSIWYG editor.‚ÄÇBut there are problems, lots of them.</p> <h2 id="you-dont-get-what-you-see">You don‚Äôt get what you see!</h2> <p>Yes, most of the times, you usually don‚Äôt get what you see.‚ÄÇThat‚Äôs just how things are.‚ÄÇWhen you can try to make sure it‚Äôs close enough that‚Äôs not much of a problem.‚ÄÇSometimes you even want the product to look different,¬†e.‚ÄØg.¬†eBooks need to able to reflow.</p> <p>But the problems start when the product deviates when it shouldn‚Äôt.‚ÄÇFixing those problems is in the range from easy in a few click up to impossible.‚ÄÇWhy?
