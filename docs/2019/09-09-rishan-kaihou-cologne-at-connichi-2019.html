Not all of us could get a day off.‚ÄÇSo Manuel and I left Cologne for Kassel at 15:00.‚ÄÇWe have 5 Sets and 4 Junkmats with us.‚ÄÇWe planned for a maximum of 2‚ÄØto‚ÄØ3 tables but it never hurts to have some extra. A few hours later we check into the hostel, we quickly refresh ourselves and hurry to the convention with enough materials for 3 tables.‚ÄÇWe finally arrive by 19:00.‚ÄÇWe‚Äôre welcomed by a surprise: people have been asking for us in the first few hours of the convention quite a lot.‚ÄÇThe section Games Unplugged is relieved to see us.‚ÄÇKai and Nico have been there quite early but Manuel and I have had all the materials.‚ÄÇWe can finally fulfill the demand of Mahjong! We set up a table and start teaching the game to interested people.‚ÄÇFor that, we adapt the Tibet Rules to our needs.‚ÄÇThe tables we are provided with aren‚Äôt quadratic so we adapt to that by putting the mat diagonally.‚ÄÇThe demand just gets higher.‚ÄÇWe set up a 2nd table.‚ÄÇI speak my mind: ‚ÄúIf this continues, we might need to get another set from the car.‚Äù On Saturday, we get visitors that already knew how to play and just want to play with us.‚ÄÇSome event want to learn beatori.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm still busy with teaching but table 1 as finishing up their beginner lesson.‚ÄÇSo they play at table 1. But as if the weekend hasn‚Äôt already been eventful enough some Japanese people turn up and want to play with us.‚ÄÇI learn they have been looking for us on Friday.‚ÄÇSadly, I didn‚Äôt get to play them.‚ÄÇSo if you want to hear more, you‚Äôll have to ask Nico or Manuel. It‚Äôs around noon.‚ÄÇAn enthusiastic ‚ÄúTsumo!‚Äù can be heard in the rooms of Games Unplugged at Connichi in Kassel.‚ÄÇI turn my head towards table 1.‚ÄÇNico announces his hand: ‚ÄúSuuankou tanki matchi!‚Äù‚ÄÇThose who know what it means are in awe.‚ÄÇTo the others we explain what a yakuman is. And what a double yakuman is. By the way, congratulations to Nico for his first Yakuman! We get even more people.‚ÄÇI look around, but there‚Äôs no place for a third table.‚ÄÇI walk around a bit.‚ÄÇIn the entrance area of the 2nd floor, there‚Äôs still some space.‚ÄÇSince the area of Games Unplugged is the whole 2nd floor I set up a table with high tables there.‚ÄÇThose round tables are quite perfect in size.‚ÄÇBut you have to stand with those high tables.‚ÄÇI swipe some high chairs from the balcony.‚ÄÇAfter the lesson, I take the materials back into the room with me.‚ÄÇThe entrance area can‚Äôt be locked up and I‚Äôm not a fan of leaving our materials unattended. On Sunday we encounter a familiar problem: we need a 3rd table.‚ÄÇSo another table is set up in the entrance area.‚ÄÇSince it‚Äôs for a group of people that already play I leave them and visit once in a while.‚ÄÇA little later I‚Äôm being called outside: ‚ÄúThai, can you come quickly? We need help with scoring.‚Äù‚ÄÇOf course, I get out to help. Huh? A very rare hand awaits me: Sunday is nearing its end.‚ÄÇIt was an exhausting weekend.‚ÄÇExhausting but fun.‚ÄÇIf the Connichi doesn‚Äôt mind we‚Äôd like to come next year as well.‚ÄÇ " } ] } </script> <h1> Rinshan Kaihou at Connichi 2019 </h1> <div id="talkify-metadata" aria-flowto="chapter-content"> <small class="float-left mr-1"> published on 2019-09-09, last updated on 2021-06-12 </small> <small class="float-left float-lg-right text-left text-lg-right"> written by <a href="https://0xreki.de" target="_blank" ref="noopener">Thai ‚Äú0xReki‚Äù Chung</a>, checked with <a href="https://prowritingaid.com/en/Analysis/WebEditor/Go?afid=9599" target="_blank" ref="noopener" rel="sponsored">ProWritingAid</a> </small> <div aria-hidden="true" class="clearfix"></div> <small> tagged with <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/games/">Games</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/hobbies/">Hobbies</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/riichi-mahjong/">Riichi Mahjong</a>, <a href="https://0xreki.de/tags/conventions/">Conventions</a> </small> </div> <nav class="d-flex w-100 clearfix"> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary previous" title=" My Thoughts About Vegetarian and Vegan Stuff" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2019/08-14-my-thoughts-about-vegetarian-and-vegan-stuff">My Thoughts About Vegetarian and Vegan Stuff</a> <a class="btn btn-lg btn-primary next" title="What I hate about Games in 2019" href="https://0xreki.github.io/2019/11-22-what-i-hate-about-games-in-2019">What I hate about Games in 2019</a> </nav> </header> <div class="d-inline-flex w-100 my-2 align-items-center tts-controls"> <p class="w-50 w-md-25 mb-0">Text to Speech:</p> <input id="tts" aria-label="Toggle Text-to-Speech" type="checkbox" data-toggle="toggle" data-off="‚è∏&#xFE0E;&ensp;&nbsp;" data-on="&ensp;&nbsp;‚ñ∂Ô∏è&#xFE0E;" data-onstyle="green" data-offstyle="red" data-size="lg" data-width="100%"> </div> <section class="hyphenate" property="text" aria-flowto="navigation" id="post-content"> <!--sse--> <p>Saturday, ‚ÄØSeptember 7th, 2019, it‚Äôs about noon.‚ÄÇAn enthusiastic ‚ÄúTsumo!‚Äù can be heard in the rooms of Games Unplugged at Connichi in Kassel.‚ÄÇ<img src="https://0xreki.github.io/blog/images/2019-09-09-connichi.png" alt="Logo of Connichi" /></p> <p>If you have been at Connichi last weekend probably knows about it: we have been invited to Connichi 2019 in Kassel to show the world the joys of Riichi Mahjong.</p> <p>Not all of us could get a day off.‚ÄÇSo Manuel and I left Cologne for Kassel at 15:00.‚ÄÇWe have 5 Sets and 4 Junkmats with us.‚ÄÇWe planned for a maximum of 2‚ÄØto‚ÄØ3 tables but it never hurts to have some extra.</p> <p>A few hours later we check into the hostel, we quickly refresh ourselves and hurry to the convention with enough materials for 3 tables.‚ÄÇWe finally arrive by 19:00.‚ÄÇWe‚Äôre welcomed by a surprise: people have been asking for us in the first few hours of the convention quite a lot.‚ÄÇThe section Games Unplugged is relieved to see us.‚ÄÇKai and Nico have been there quite early but Manuel and I have had all the materials.‚ÄÇWe can finally fulfill the demand of Mahjong!</p> <p>We set up a table and start teaching the game to interested people.‚ÄÇFor that, we adapt the Tibet Rules to our needs.‚ÄÇThe tables we are provided with aren‚Äôt quadratic so we adapt to that by putting the mat diagonally.‚ÄÇThe demand just gets higher.‚ÄÇWe set up a 2nd table.‚ÄÇI speak my mind: ‚ÄúIf this continues, we might need to get another set from the car.‚Äù</p> <p>On Saturday, we get visitors that already knew how to play and just want to play with us.‚ÄÇSome event want to learn beatori.‚ÄÇI‚Äôm still busy with teaching but table 1 as finishing up their beginner lesson.‚ÄÇSo they play at table 1.</p> <p>But as if the weekend hasn‚Äôt already been eventful enough some Japanese people turn up and want to play with us.‚ÄÇI learn they have been looking for us on Friday.‚ÄÇSadly, I didn‚Äôt get to play them.‚ÄÇSo if you want to hear more, you‚Äôll have to ask Nico or Manuel.</p> <p>It‚Äôs around noon.‚ÄÇAn enthusiastic ‚ÄúTsumo!‚Äù can be heard in the rooms of <a href="https://www.connichi.de/programm/games-unplugged/">Games Unplugged</a> at Connichi in Kassel.‚ÄÇI turn my head towards table 1.‚ÄÇNico announces his hand: ‚ÄúSuuankou tanki matchi!‚Äù‚ÄÇThose who know what it means are in awe.‚ÄÇTo the others we explain what a yakuman is.
