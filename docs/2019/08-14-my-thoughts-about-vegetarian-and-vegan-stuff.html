I do enjoy good vegetarian food.‚ÄÇAlso, as an Asian I think tofu is quite nice if you don‚Äôt treat it as meat replacement.‚ÄÇBut everywhere you go, you see the nasty meat replacement in the vegetarian sections!‚ÄÇAnd because of that I see people everywhere react negatively to the word tofu.‚ÄÇBecause in the meat-eaters mind tofu equal meat-replacement.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs not. While I haven‚Äôt ever seen a vegetarian complain about bad meat replacement I do have seen people working around it.‚ÄÇOne day, I saw a professor at the meat buffet.‚ÄÇI knew she was vegetarian.‚ÄÇOf course I asked her about it.‚ÄÇI mean, meat buffet and vegetarian, something doesn‚Äôt match.‚ÄÇ‚ÄúThe salad here tastes better than the vegetarian food they have.‚Äù‚ÄÇy point exactly. I hear meat-eaters complaining about vegetarian food all the time.‚ÄÇIt would taste bad.‚ÄÇYes,¬†as I said, tofu meat replacement tastes bad!‚ÄÇHave you ever eaten good vegetarian food?‚ÄÇA meal without meat replacement?‚ÄÇUsually I get a no.‚ÄÇOf course, this is not only a problem from the meat-eater side.‚ÄÇSome vegetarian think it‚Äôs a good idea to show off meat replacement to people that aren‚Äôt interested.‚ÄÇPlease, just don‚Äôt do that!‚ÄÇDon‚Äôt go there saying it doesn‚Äôt taste that bad.‚ÄÇeat-eaters expect it to taste like meat, any other result will be a failure in their eyes. Show the other food you make and you‚Äôll get much better results.‚ÄÇI mean, at events that do organize good vegetarian food, you often see the non-vegetarians eat the vegetarian food. Sometimes to the extend the vegetarians don‚Äôt have enough.‚ÄÇNo,¬†that‚Äôs not an outlier.‚ÄÇI‚Äôve seen it multiple times before.‚ÄÇSo you might need to plan for it and allocate more of it.‚ÄÇOr keep the meat-eaters away from the vegetarian food. Some people joke about vegan declaration on plant-based products or non-food products.‚ÄÇThe latter is just huge misinformation on how vegans communicated veganism over a long time: until recently (a few years now), I thought veganism means not eating animal and their products; and it‚Äôs just a term describing their eating habits ‚Äî a food term only.‚ÄÇWith that definition I can‚Äôt help but laugh about the thought a vegan might at a vegan declared soap, that‚Äôs all to it. I haven‚Äôt thought about veganism, I regularly consume meat.‚ÄÇSo using other products that come from animals isn‚Äôt that a big deal.‚ÄÇIn fact, why shouldn‚Äôt I?‚ÄÇI‚Äôd be a waste not to use all of the cow! Or pig.‚ÄÇBut veganism isn‚Äôt only about food.‚ÄÇIt‚Äôs about not exploiting animals at all.‚ÄÇSo extending the vegan declaration to non-food items makes sense.‚ÄÇBut people forgot to tell the non-vegans about it.‚ÄÇAnd instead of properly explaining things, most vegans immediately feel insulted and start insulting others for not caring. So now you‚Äôre in the zone of people that annoy me.‚ÄÇAnd if you do that, I stop respecting your opinion, you don‚Äôt deserve that anymore. Not all though, at least the people that I met in the Student‚Äôs Union were quite level-headed and explained things to me.‚ÄÇWe had quite a healthy discussion.‚ÄÇWould I buy vegan mustard over non-vegan mustard?‚ÄÇProbably not, after all, I‚Äôm putting it on a piece of meat.‚ÄÇSo its ingredient being filtered using gelatine isn‚Äôt that a big deal.‚ÄÇI‚Äôd buy it for shared use in the Student‚Äôs Union office, though.‚ÄÇAfter all, we do have vegetarians and vegans.‚ÄÇAnd this time it really does taste the same.‚ÄÇHow about vegan soap? Why do I have to think about the Camel Dung Soap from Ragnar√∂k Online?1 I better check what‚Äôs actually in my soap‚Ä¶ In the Veins Siblings Quest, you find a little girl chained in a dungeon.‚ÄÇTo free her, you need to feed a Silk Sand Camel until you get 5 bottles of dung so you can get the soap to make a mold for the locksmith to create a key for you.‚ÄÇ¬†&#8617;
