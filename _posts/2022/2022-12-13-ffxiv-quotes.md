excerpt: |
  Let's talk about superstitions.
  Being a occult player, I will not try to disprove any of these.
  There are other people that do that, so I don't have to.
  Sure, there are some I follow and others I don't subscribe to that much.
  Good superstitions are just some shorthand for some complex math, I don't need to bother thinking about.
