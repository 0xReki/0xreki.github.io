“Golden Sun: Dark Dawn” is a JRPG made by Camelot which was released 2010 for Nintendo DS and sequel to “Golden Sun: The Lost Age”.

30 years after the events of “Golden Sun: The Lost Age”, the descendants of the Warriors of Vale set out on a journey for a simple errand.
As they are forced to take another route by a group of shady characters, they find themselves in an unfamiliar place and try to find an alternative route to their original destination.
What is that group plotting?

Being a fan of the series, I enthusiastically pre-ordered a copy of “Dark Dawn” as soon as I heard about it.
When I told my fellow Golden Sun fans about it, they all had the same question: “If Matthew is Isaac's son, who did Isaac marry?”.
Spoilers, the anwser is Jenna.

But I was rather disappointed upon clearing the game way too fast and too easily.
I guess it is good not to be too challenging, but then even the secret Boss Dullahan, who was considered the ultimate Boss in „Golden Sun: The Lost Age“ was a pushover in “Golden Sun: Dark Dawn”!
It definitely lacks the feature to play on a higher difficulty.

I'd rank it with 3 of 10.
There's still hope the possible sequel might fix the issue.
