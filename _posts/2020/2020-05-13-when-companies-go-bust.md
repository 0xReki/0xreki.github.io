title: "When Companies Go Bust…"
---
Just as things are starting to take off again, I'm struck with bad news:
it seems my domain provider haven't paid their bills and my domains were released.
Good thing is DENIC, i. e. the authority for .de domains, has a system in place that helps against others snatching those domains.
But it also means I have to take care of it soon: finding a new provider etc.
And pay the bill for a new domain subscription. (Damn…)

Why do I use .de domains? I'm from Germany and that's the cheapest domain I can get that doesn't look dodgy.

Anyway, I'm hoping I can get back to writing soon.
Crystal Down Chapter 1-45 will release on 2020-05-18 to the public.
