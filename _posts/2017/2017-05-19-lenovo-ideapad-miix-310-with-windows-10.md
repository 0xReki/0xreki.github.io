My mobile internet contract was about to end, so it was time to extend it and while doing that getting a new tablet.

Up until now I've only had Android tablets: Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy Tab A.
But as I'm not afraid to try out new stuff I thought: “Try out a Windows tablet and after a few weeks post a review on your blog.”
So I got a [Lenovo Ideapad Miix 310 with Windows 10](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/tablets/windows-tablets/miix-series/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Miix-310/p/88EMMX30692) for this.

To my opinion, the specs are quite average:

- The Intel Atom x5-Z8350 Processor has 4 cores clocking at 1.44 to 1.92 GHz.
- Despite the specs on the Lenovo homepage stating only up to 2 GB of DDR3L RAM my tablet has 4 GB of DDR3 RAM.
- The tablet doesn't have a dedicated graphics chip. It uses its Intel Integrated Graphics.
- The screen itself is 10.1 inches at 1280x800 pixels.

The tablet itself feels well-made.
Instead of a micro USB port, it uses a DC plug for charging.
The power adapter is rated with 5V at 4A.
Though it has a micro USB port, you cannot use that to charge the device.
In fact, you can't even use that port to connect to a computer to transfer data — it's a host port.
The other ports it has are a micro HDMI and a headset jack.
The keyboard is a 60% keyboard: it has only alphanumeric keys plus some extra keys crammed in.
It has a metal top plate and two full size USB A ports.
I like how it looks and feels.
The only complaint I have here: the Intel Atom x5 sticker looks crooked.

Since this tablet features dockable keyboard and a real Windows 10 Home Edition it can run real Windows programs as well.
I can run low graphics games like 100% Orange Juice and League of Legends.
But that's all what I can say in favour of this tablet.

This tablet is a netbook with touchscreen and detachable keyboard.
Windows and the apps store are where this acts like a netbook: the system keeps turning off.
You want to be notified if someone sends you an SMS?
Nope, the sound turns off whenever you close the lid.
You want to install your messengers on your tablet as it your main data access?
Nope, the apps in store don't see this as a mobile device.
The nail in the coffin is its screen.
While sitting in the train, I noticed the screen is not very bright.
The brightness is reminiscent of netbook screens.

Sure, you can change the power settings to suit my needs.
And you can probably force installation of the apps by  esideloadingtc.
All that said, as a tablet it's somewhat lacking.
As a netbook, it's definitely great.
