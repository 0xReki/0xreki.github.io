“We are swimming in Christianity” is a statement I've recently heard.
I disagree.
I don't usually speak or write much about my faith.
They say, inaction is the greatest evil, so I'll just have to force myself to do it.
When this post gets published, it should be shortly before Christmas.
Let's take the time and really look at this: are we, the Western society, really swimming in Christianity?
This post contains a lot of views people might disagree with, but these views I have are the result of me having actually engaged with my faith.
Faith is more than just rituals.

## Core Message of Christianity

I was born in Germany, baptized and raised a Roman Catholic.
But if that's all that is needed to count, sure, we are swimming in Christianity, on paper.
From shortly before and well after my confirmation, my teachers in religious education, religious mentors and priests conveyed the core message in any faith that calls itself a Christian one should be the principle of loving one's neighbour.
What does it mean?
Let's start with forgiving people seek forgiveness, altruistic action, not excluding people because of their gender, their looks, their race, their religion, or their sexuality and meeting them with respect.
This also includes not harassing people for being or thinking different.
Those that act like this can be considered true Christians, regardless if they are baptized or even believe in God at all.

## Looking West

Looking at the Western world, I see rampant cooperate greed, bullying, sexism, transgyny, homogyny, racism, antisemitism, etc.
Things that just prove how much we are not swimming in Christianity.
Especially bullying should not exist in any community claiming to Christian, our society should be above that.
Instead, society turns a blind eye towards bullying and even actively joins in the bullying.

Some might argue, those people are heathens, belonging to other non-Christian religions, or not real Christians.
If they aren't Christians, we are not swimming in Christianity.

You might have noticed people claiming they are “at least a million times as humble as thou art!”
Seems like, stroking one's ego isn't a phenomenon that started with the internet.
I don't care how much you think how holy you think you are, or what illness you believe is a punishment from God.
What matters is what you say and how you act.
And if you are truly Christian, put benevolence first, even to those you believe are sinners.

## Science and Faith

I've seen countless times people claiming Science and Faith are mutually exclusive.
I disagree.
To me, trusting in God doesn't mean I reject science.

God works in unseen ways, you cannot expect God to change the laws of nature.
Sometimes, he works through the actions of people around you.
If you don't use all of what humanity has achieved to improve and save lives, and expect God to magically fix it, you're rejecting his help.
That is why I got vaccinated and wear a face mask, even though I have trouble breathing through it.

Sure, there could have been side effects, potentially deadly.
But those could be mitigated, and my doctor told me what signs I could take to the hospital immediately.
While I got the usual fever and aches, my phone died, and friends personally came over to check on me.
To this day, just this one visit made me feel blessed.

I didn't get complications, but I could have gotten them.
In the worst case, I could have overlooked the signs of coming complications.
I could have fainted alone in my flat and have nobody notice it.
My friends could have all not remember me getting a shot that very weekend and not paid me a visit.
But none of that happened.
Did he actually do something?
I don't need to know.

Sometimes, he works through the actions of humans.
You cannot expect God to change the laws of nature.
If we want to limit the effects of climate change, we need to act.
We were given the means to detect it before it's too late, we should act on it.
While I have very mixed views on gene testing and manipulation, inaction and expecting God fix climate change for us is what I call not respecting creation at all.

## Possessed by Evil?

But hey, there are people that say I'm possessed by evil, so what do I know?
Maybe they were right, I've put off writing this post for quite a while.
I have felt the need to write this a long time ago, but I was paralyzed with fear of how people would react to this post.
But some things happened privately, and I had much time to think about it.
They say inaction is the greatest evil.
I have to agree with that.

## Engaging with Your Faith

Maybe this post will reach people that are currently engaging with their faith.
And I hope they will agree with me, or at least take this into account when they think about what their faith really means to them.
It's much likely this post will gather hate.
I have to admit, I'm too weak to unilaterally say I forgive that.
I am by no means a saint, but I believe being a true Christian means to continuously work on myself and the world.
Not excluding people because of their gender, their looks, their race, their religion, or their sexuality and meeting them with respect — I still catch myself thinking afoul of these, especially when I'm met with disrespect.

With all said, when I look at the current state of the Western society that's supposedly to be *so* Christian, I can't help but feel sad.
This Christian society could be so much better if those that claim to be Christian actually act like ones.
