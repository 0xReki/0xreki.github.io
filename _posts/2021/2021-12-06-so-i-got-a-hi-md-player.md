Well, I'm in my early 30s and I suddenly got that urge to get me some stuff couldn't have when I was younger.
So I did some research into what ever happened with magnetic-optical-technology, especially the Sony MiniDisc.

While I didn't find out what happened to other MO-technology, I did find out that Sony introduced Hi-MD in 2004, only to discontinue it in 2011.
Some Hi-MD players can actually store other data than audio and even play MP3s.
Two things that make the whole MD thing better!!

So in 2016, I ordered an MZ-NH600, MZ-NH1 are way overpriced, and a bunch of MDs only to learn Sony discontinued their software SonicStage.
Not only that, they even stopped serving the software at all.
After some digging, I found a [community-pached version of SonicStage](https://forums.sonyinsider.com/files/file/95-sonicstage-43-ultimate-edition/){:ref="nofollow"} that runs with current Windows.

What's new?
I finally got around to buying Hi-fi components, I got an Onkyo MD-105FX from Japan.
The trouble is, I live in Germany and the device is from Japan.
Differences in the plugs aside, here in Germany, the electrical system run at 230V at 50 Hz, the device from Japan takes 100V at 50 or 60 Hz.
It uses the same plug as the US, but the US seems to run at 120V at 60 Hz.
Given the price of these units, it's rather not use these at the wrong voltage.
And it's hard to find a transformer that'd get me the 100 Volts I need.
I'm not getting a 230V to 120V one and then plug in another one for 120V to 100V.
Oh, and I did buy a power converter from Japan, but upon closer inspection, it says not plug in Hi-fi equipment into it.
I got another transformer that claims to do 110V, but I don't have measuring tools around to test it.
It might just be a mislabelling, just like everyone claims it's 220V here in Europe, but it's actually 230V.
We used to have 220V in mainland Europe, until 1987.
Since then, European countries moved to 230V, with the standard made to be within the 220V spec.
This transformer might actually provide 110V, since it claims to take 230V.

After some digging, I found a manufacturer that sells custom-made transformers, but it's bulky and overspecced.
I don't need 1000W to power a MiniDisc player.
Plus, it's 2021 and that manufacturer is in the UK.
And I don't need two of these… yet.

By the way, I'm still not used to handling MDs, I keep putting them in like 3.5" floppies.
Compared to those, MDs go in “sideways”.
