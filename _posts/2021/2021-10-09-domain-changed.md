As you might have noticed, this page has moved to a new domain: reki.wtf.
RIP search engine rankings.
Why did I move?
Actually, I had a lot of reasons…

## The Past

Let's start with the old domain: 0xreki.de.
It was just based on the handle I commonly use: 0xReki.
It's a strange handle, I know.

When I started going by Reki on the internet, that handle was sometimes taken.
While people seem to just say, it's fine, I wanted something I can use everywhere.
Just by adding the 0x prefix to make it look geekier, I had a handle that was available to on almost all platforms.
Yes, some platforms don't permit the handle starting with a digit… but those platforms came later.

Being a latecomer, reki.de was already taken by reiki.de, a page about Reiki, whatever that is.
I had looked at it, and decided it was not worth remembering what it was.
Anyway, I tried reaching out to them to buy it from them, but they ignored me.

Sure, I could have tried registering a trademark and then sue them like a certain German Formula 1 racer, but that's against how I see registered domains should work on the internet.
So in the end, I went with 0xreki.de.

## User Habits

As you know, I host [Doman Mahjong Tournaments in Final Fantasy XIV](/doman/).
One part of it is trying to get players in Final Fantasy XIV to join.
For numerous reasons, some people can't copy the URL I post to a browser.
So they try to type in the URL and half of the people think it's a capital o, not the numeral 0.
Sure, I could just buy oxreki.de, but people view both domains with suspicion, as people seem to have trouble pronouncing it.
Some people even thought 0x was a typo and visited reki.de, and got to a page about Reiki, whatever that is.
And I totally get it.

Granted, for many, reki.wtf also looks suspicious, but I believe that's just because it's a new top level domain.

## Better Relation to Content

I have to admit, I do rant a lot on my blog.
So having a .wtf top level domain, does fit it more than a .de top level domain, which many would associate in German.

## eMail

Since I own the domain, I also have my emails on that domain.
But some address validators don't like the domain starting with a digit.
I hope this new domain get accepted by those, but I doubt it.

## The Future

I won't release my domains, I did that once, and I still have to deal with the fallout of that decision.
I might write about what can go and went wrong some time in the future.

In short:

- <reki.wtf> will be the main domain for this page.

- ~~<0xreki.de> will contain all static resources for this page.~~

- <amau.ga> are short URLs for [Amauga](/amauga/).

- <cd-ht.ml> are short URLs for [Crystal Down](/crystaldown/) and [Crystal Down: Scions](/scions/).

All old URLs should be redirected to the new domain, if you find some that don't work, please [send me a message](/contact/).
