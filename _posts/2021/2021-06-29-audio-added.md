title: Sample Audio Files Added
---
You may have noticed I added some audio to [Amauga: Chapter 1](https://0xreki.de/amauga/01-far-from-any-semblance-of-modern-civilization/001-quick-starting-my-summer-break/) and the post [Blog Technology 2021](https://0xreki.de/2021/06-23-blog-technology-2021/).

I'm not a great narrator, so I put it in Amazon Polly and fiddled around with it.
What are your thoughts on the resulting audio?

If you have feedback to give, feel free to [send me a message](/contact/) or join the [{{ site.title }} Discord](https://discord.gg/8DCZWGc)!
If I'm to be honest, the latter might be faster.
