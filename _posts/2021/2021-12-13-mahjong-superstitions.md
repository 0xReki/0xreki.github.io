  Let's talk about superstitions.
  Being a occult player, I will not try to disprove any of these.
  There are other people that do that, so I don't have to.
  Sure, there are some I follow and others I don't subscribe to that much.
  Good superstitions are just some shorthand for some complex math, I don't need to bother thinking about.

If you don't believe in these, that's fine.
Just be civil about it.

## Lalafell have better luck in Doman Mahjong

Let's start with a current one: it seems, Lalafell have all the luck in Doman Mahjong.
Maybe, it's more Lalafell reach a higher level in Doman Mahjong.
Or it's because they're so a*dora*ble!
Granted, this feels like you can extend this to all of Final Fantasy XIV Online: Lalafell seem to have better luck in this game!
Maybe it's because Yoshida-san plays a Lalafell, but maybe it's just a selective impressionâ€¦

## Red Underwear

OK, this is something I just randomly found while researching.
Apparently, red underwear brings luck.
I would try this out, but opening my drawer, I only found blue and black pants.

## Shuffling Tiles

I heard the noise of shuffling tiles is supposed to bring luck.
So shuffle like you mean it!
