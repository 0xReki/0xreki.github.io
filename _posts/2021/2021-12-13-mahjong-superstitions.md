  Let's talk about superstitions.
  Being a occult player, I will not try to disprove any of these.
  There are other people that do that, so I don't have to.
  Sure, there are some I follow and others I don't subscribe to that much.
  Good superstitions are just some shorthand for some complex math, I don't need to bother thinking about.

Let's talk about superstitions.
Being an occult player, I will not try to disprove any of these.
There are other people that do that, so I don't have to.
Sure, there are some I follow and others I don't subscribe to that much.
I see it that way: good superstitions are just some shorthand for some complex math, I don't need to bother thinking about it.
If you don't believe in these, that's fine.
Just be civil about it.

## “Lalafell have all the luck in Doman Mahjong”

Let's start with a current one.
Granted, this feels like you can extend this to all of Final Fantasy XIV Online: Lalafell seem to an influence on luck.
More opening gates, more loot, better rolls on loot, more kandora, more uradora, more ippatsu tsumos.
However, you might need to murder the Lalafell in your group with Rescue for the luck to trigger.
Or convince the Lalafell to commit suicide.
Somehow, that sounds wrong…

## “If you're 3rd, and the last dealer is 4th, he will go on a luck streak and blast your ass down to 4th.”

This is a situation you commonly see in online games:
One player, the last dealer, barely wins any hands, but on their orasu, they start winning.
Sometimes they win so much, they get even first.

## Clothes

What kind of clothes do you wear while playing mahjong?
Apparently, wearing red underwear brings luck in mahjong.
I'm not entirely convinced, think it should be yellow, if you subscribe to this.
I would try this out, but after opening my drawer, I've only found blue and black pants.

## “Reversing the Flow”

You play at an automatic table and have bad luck?
You can try this at your own risk: try reversing the polarity!
Unplug the table, turn the plug by 180 degrees and plug it in again.
Or use a sonic screwdriver.
Whatever works.

## “Gotta go fast”

## Shuffling Tiles

I heard the noise of shuffling tiles is supposed to bring luck.
So shuffle like you mean it!
