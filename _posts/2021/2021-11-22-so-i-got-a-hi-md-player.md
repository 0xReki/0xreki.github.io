Well, I'm in my early 30s and I suddenly got that urge to get me some stuff couldn't have when I was younger.
So I did some research into what ever happened with magnetic-optical-technology, especially the Sony MiniDisc.

While I didn't find out what happened to other MO-technology, I did find out that Sony introduced Hi-MD in 2004, only to discontinue it in 2011.
Some Hi-MD players can actually store other data than audio and even play MP3s.
Two things that make the whole MD thing better!!

So in 2016, I ordered an MZ-NH600 and a bunch of MDs only to learn Sony discontinued their software SonicStage.
Not only that, they even stopped serving the software at all.
After some digging, I found a [community-pached version of SonicStage](https://forums.sonyinsider.com/files/file/95-sonicstage-43-ultimate-edition/){:ref="nofollow"} that runs with current Windows.

What new?
I finally got around to buying Hi-Fi components, I got an Onkyo MD-105FX from Japan.
The trouble is, I live in Germany and the device is from Japan.
Differences in the plugs aside, here in Germany, the electrical system run at 230V at 50 Hz, the device from Japan takes 100V at 50 or 60 Hz.
It uses the same plug as the US, but the US seems to run at 110V at 60 Hz.
Given the price of these units, it's rather not use these at the wrong voltage.
And it's hard to find a transformer that'd get me the 100 Volts I need.
I'm not getting a 230V to 120V one and then plug in another one for 120 V to 100V.

After some digging, I found a manufacturer that sells custom-made transformers, but it's bulky and overspecced
I don't need that much power to use a MiniDisc player.
Plus, it's 2021 and the manufacturer is in the UK.

By the way, I'm totally not used to handling MDs, I keep putting them in like 3.5" floppies, MDs go in “sideways”.
