## Format

4+ Hanchan Round-Robin'ish.
As before, it depends on how many people attend.

Since I'm trying to accommodate players from all over the globe, the games don't have necessarily to be in one single block each day.
Having more slots just helps a lot with not playing the same people each time.

All games will be played in Final Fantasy XIV Online as friendly matches “Full Game Four-player Mahjong (Kuitan Enabled)” on Data Centre Light.
Don't be confused, what Doman Mahjong considers a “Full Game” is just a Hanchan, it's *not* an Iichan.
After the game, since FFXIV doesn't have logs and spectator mode (yet! Yoshi-P, please add one for us!) the result should be screenshotted and sent to the organizer.

## Final Fantasy XIV Online

All games are being played in [Final Fantasy XIV Online](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/).
To play, a trial account is sufficient.
You only need to [unlock the Gold Saucer](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/It_Could_Happen_to_You).
Note, if you're not new to Mahjong, it's recommended to change the display from actual dora to dora indicator.
