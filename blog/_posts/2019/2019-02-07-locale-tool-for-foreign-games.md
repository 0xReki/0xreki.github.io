I have old Windows games running.
Some games, especially foreign ones, require the correct locale set to be even installed and run.
And if you need multiple locales you'd need to reboot any time you change the locale in Windows.
And with Windows currently needing up to 10 minutes to reboot for no apparent reason I thought there should be better solution to this.

I found [xupefei/Locale-Emulator](https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}<!--_-->.
It's perfect. This tool remembers what application I installed with what locale.
And even if I need to change it, I can do that in the context menu.
