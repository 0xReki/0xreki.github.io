title: "Comment System Change"
---
You might have noticed old comments have vanished.
I have changed the comment system to something automatic, that doesn't require me manual intervention or automated pushes to my repository.
The disadvantage, of course, is I can't add the old comments to it.
I'm sorry they had to go, but I was too lazy to properly implement comments before, so I was manually adding the comments to the pages.
